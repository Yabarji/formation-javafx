JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but both will be included for the foreseeable future.[3] The current release has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.\
\n\n Before version 2.0 of JavaFX, developers used a statically typed, declarative language called JavaFX Script to build JavaFX applications. Because JavaFX Script was compiled to Java bytecode, programmers could also use Java code instead. JavaFX applications could run on any desktop that could run Java SE, on any browser that could run Java EE, or on any mobile phone that could run Java ME.\
\n\n However, JavaFX 2.0 and later is now implemented as a native Java library and therefore applications using JavaFX are written in native Java code. JavaFX Script has been scrapped by Oracle, but development is being continued in the Visage project.[4] JavaFX 2.x does not support the Solaris operating system or mobile phones; however as Oracle plans to integrate JavaFX to Java SE embedded 8, Java FX for ARM processors is currently in developer preview phase.[5]\
\n\n On desktops, the current release supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.[6] Beginning with JavaFX 1.2, Oracle has released beta versions for OpenSolaris.[7] On mobile, JavaFX Mobile 1.x is capable of running on multiple mobile operating systems, including Symbian OS, Windows Mobile, and proprietary real-time operating systems.
